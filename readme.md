# Resume site

- Please enjoy my simple resume! www.hire-kyle.dev
- The site features multiple styles for fun, and additional styles will be added in the future

## Features and implementation details

- The page has a separate print style sheet, to ensure printed page always fits on **one page**
  ```
  <link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="./stylesheets/print.css" />`
  ```
- I didn't use any libraries, so the entire site is 35KB. I could use vanilla JS to implement this pretty easily and I enjoy the quickness of the page. Using a library seems like overkill.
- The `style choice` of the website is added to the cookies, so the styling persist through refresh
- Hosted on Github pages
- Icons came from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/), fonts came from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
